## Teaching Philosophy

I believe that education should be accessible, engaging, and immediately applicable to real-world challenges. My teaching emphasizes:

- **Hands-on learning**: Working with real datasets and industry-standard tools
- **Inclusive pedagogy**: Reducing barriers to entry, especially for underrepresented groups
- **Interdisciplinary connections**: Bridging computer science, biology, and data science
