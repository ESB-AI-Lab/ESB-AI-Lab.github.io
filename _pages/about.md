**Harnessing Bioinformatics and AI to Ensure Food Security and Species Rescue in the Face of a Changing Climate**

I am a computational biologist and data scientist bridging artificial intelligence, evolutionary genomics, and climate-resilient agriculture. My research leverages cutting-edge machine learning and bioinformatics to address global food security challenges in the face of rapid climate change.

Currently, I serve as a **Lecturer at UC San Diego** in both the Computer Science and Engineering Department and the Halicioglu Data Science Institute, where I teach graduate-level courses in big data analytics and machine learning at scale. I am also a **Machine Learning Engineer at Informuta, Inc.**, applying AI solutions to real-world problems.

## Research Focus

The ES Bioinformatics and AI Lab develops and applies open-source intelligent algorithms in genomics, automation, and detection/classification. We focus on understanding plant and animal genomic regions responsible for adaptation and economically important traits, enabling crops and species to thrive as climate change impacts agriculture and biodiversity.

**Current Research Areas:**
- AI-assisted aquaculture (sturgeon sex determination)
- Crop genomics (maize, avocado)
- RNA secondary structures and gene regulation
- Open-source bioinformatics tools
- Computer vision for agriculture

## Education & Training

- **Ph.D. in Biological Sciences** (Comparative Genomics), UC Irvine, 2021
- **M.S. in Biological Sciences**, UC Irvine
- **B.S. in Biomedical Computing**, UC Irvine
- **UC President's Postdoctoral Fellow**, UC Davis, 2021-2023

## Impact

- **19 peer-reviewed publications** in *Genome Research*, *PNAS*, *G3*, and more
- **528+ citations** across computational biology and genomics
- **~$465,000 in active research funding** as PI (USDA NIFA)
- Featured in press releases at SDSC, ACCESS-CI, and major scientific media
