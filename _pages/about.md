## Forging a Sustainable Future

The **ES Bioinformatics and AI Lab** develops and applies open-source intelligent algorithms to address critical challenges in food security, species conservation, and climate resilience. We combine computational genomics, machine learning, and computer vision to understand how organisms adapt to changing environments.

## Research Areas

**AI-Assisted Aquaculture** - Developing computer vision and genomic approaches for sturgeon sex determination, reducing costs and improving sustainability of aquaculture operations. Funded by USDA NIFA ($465,851).

**Crop Genomics & Climate Resilience** - Investigating the genomic basis of adaptation in economically important crops including maize, avocado, and grapevine. Our work on avocado domestication and heterodichogamy informs breeding programs worldwide.

**RNA Biology & Gene Regulation** - Discovering novel miRNA-like secondary structures that regulate gene expression and epigenetic silencing in plants, with implications for crop improvement.

**Antimicrobial Resistance** - Applying deep learning to predict and forecast antimicrobial resistance patterns from genomic data (collaboration with Informuta, Inc.).
