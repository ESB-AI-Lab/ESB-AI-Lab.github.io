## Overview

We discovered novel miRNA-like secondary structures in maize (*Zea mays*) genes and transposable elements that correlate with small RNA production, DNA methylation patterns, and gene expression levels. This breakthrough reveals previously unknown regulatory mechanisms in one of the world's most important food crops.

## Key Findings

- **Diverse patterns** of RNA secondary structures exist across genes and transposable elements
- These structures are **strongly associated** with siRNA production
- RNA structure explains **up to 27% of variation** in siRNA production across transposable element families
- Structures correlate with **epigenetic silencing** (DNA methylation)
- Discovered **new class of tiny RNAs** in maize genes with regulatory potential

## Impact

**Scientific:** First comprehensive demonstration that RNA structure plays a functional role in triggering gene silencing in plants

**Agricultural:** Provides new targets for crop improvement through epigenetic engineering

**Computational:** Developed open-source pipelines for RNA structure analysis at genome scale
