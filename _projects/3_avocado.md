## Overview

We created the first comprehensive reference genome for the Gwen avocado cultivar and used comparative genomics to uncover the domestication history of avocado (*Persea americana*). Our analysis revealed three independent domestication events and identified genomic regions contributing to heterodichogamy.

## Genome Assembly

- Long-read sequencing (PacBio) to create high-quality reference genome
- Assembled **49,450 genes** across **12 pseudo-chromosomes**
- N50 of **3.37 megabases**
- BUSCO score of **91%**

## Key Findings

### Domestication History
- Identified **3 independent domestication events** from wild populations
- The commercially dominant **Hass avocado** variety originated from **Guatemalan ancestry**
- Evidence for domestication events occurring over **1 million years ago**

### Heterodichogamy Genetics
- Discovered genomic regions associated with A-type vs B-type flowering
- Identified candidate genes for flowering time control

## Impact

**Scientific:** First reference-quality genome for avocado enabling future genetic studies

**Agricultural:** Informs breeding programs for improved cultivars and provides molecular markers for heterodichogamy selection

**Conservation:** Reveals genetic diversity patterns important for germplasm preservation
