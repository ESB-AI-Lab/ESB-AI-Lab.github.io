## Overview

We developed and validated a cost-effective approach for assembling high-quality reference genomes using low-coverage, long-read sequencing. This methodological innovation democratized genomic research by making genome assembly accessible to labs with limited budgets.

## The Problem

Traditional genome assembly approaches faced critical limitations:
- **High cost**: $10,000-50,000 per genome
- **Complexity**: Required extensive computational expertise
- **Time**: Months of bioinformatics work per genome
- **Inaccessibility**: Only well-funded labs could assemble multiple genomes

## Our Approach

We demonstrated that combining:
- **Low-coverage long-read sequencing** (PacBio ~20-30X coverage)
- **Strategic use of reference genomes** from closely related species
- **Optimized assembly algorithms**

Could produce **reference-quality genomes at <10% of traditional costs**.

## Key Findings

### Assembly Quality
- Achieved **reference-quality contiguity** (N50 >1 Mb)
- **>98% gene completeness** (BUSCO assessment)
- Accurate representation of structural variants

### Cost-Benefit Analysis
- **90% cost reduction** compared to traditional methods
- **10X faster** assembly pipeline
- **Total cost: <$2,000 per genome** (vs. $20,000+ traditional)

## Impact

- Cited **75+ times** in genome assembly literature
- Method adopted by dozens of labs worldwide
- Enabled research in diverse organisms (insects, plants, fungi)
- Contributed to "genomics democratization" movement
